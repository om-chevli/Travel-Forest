# Travel-Forest
This is a project website which I made for my collage assignment. The criteria for this website was to use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
In this project I got myself exposed with Sass, which is the preprocessor of CSS3. 
I also used jQuery framework for adding up to JavaScript.
It was a fun project.
